### My Thoughts

I read the article "GraphQL vs REST? What Are They and Which Is Better for You?" Prior to reading this I had no knowledge of GraphQL and some about REST APIs. This article reinforced what I knew about REST APIs and made GraphQL easy to grasp. It explained how REST operates through standard HTTP methods using server objects as resources that are retrieved through URLs. GraphQL on the other hand lets clients query exactly what data they need. The article makes an analogy to a buffet to explain how REST excels in more straightforward usage while GraphQL is better when specific data is needed quickly. The article concludes that neither is actually better than the other and that picking one should depend on the project. This article was interesting to me because it opened the door to a new application.
